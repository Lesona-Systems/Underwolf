# Underwolf

Underwolf is my current best answer to updating my World of Warcraft addons. It utilizes Python's built-in webbrowser library to navigate to CurseForge download pages and download the specified addons, unzip them, and move them into the WoW addon folder.

The script currently requires uBlock Origin and it's ability to "fast-forward" the imposed 5-second wait time before the download starts on CurseForge download pages (-_-). Without uBlock Origin, the script will not work.

Underwolf currently has no version checking, meaning that the script will redownload every addon each time it is run, which isn't ideal. I've found it worth logging in and seeing if any priority addons need updating and running then deciding whether or not to run the script.

Tested on MacOS Ventura v13.0 Beta (22A5352e) and Windows 11 (Stable) using Firefox 104.0.2 with uBlockOrigin 1.44.4 as of September 22, 2022.
